# FIFO Interface

Use fifo `/tmp/swcpipei` to send sharecodes in `CSGO-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx` format.

Use fifo `/tmp/swcpipeo` to read response. Possible responses are:

`--demo SHARECODE_TOO_OLD`

`--demo UNKNOWN_ERROR`

`--demo <demo_download_link>|<match_timestamp>`

Please note that communication has to take place 1-by-1, always wait for a response after you've sent a sharecode, otherwise the application will crash. 

This is because fifo communication requires both participants to be reading/writing, simulatenously.
